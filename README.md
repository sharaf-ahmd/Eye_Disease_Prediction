# Retinal OCT Disease Detection Platform using Deep Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a **Streamlit-based web application** for automated classification of retinal diseases using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. Utilizing a pre-trained deep learning model, the platform can accurately classify OCT images into one of four categories:

- **CNV** (Choroidal Neovascularization)
- **DME** (Diabetic Macular Edema)
- **Drusen**
- **Normal Retina**

The model was trained on a large-scale dataset of over 84,000 expert-labeled OCT scans, ensuring clinical relevance and robust performance. The application enables medical professionals and researchers to upload OCT images and receive instant predictions with detailed diagnostic insights.

## üß™ Model Training & Evaluation Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**  
   TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow Addons for advanced metrics.

2. **Load Dataset**  
   Used `image_dataset_from_directory` for loading training and validation images, resized to 224x224 with batch size 32.

3. **Analyze Class Distribution**  
   Used `Counter` and label decoding to ensure balanced class representation.

4. **Define Model Architecture**  
   - Base model: MobileNetV3Large pretrained on ImageNet.  
   - Custom Dense layer with 4 output classes and softmax activation.  
   - Optional freezing of base layers for transfer learning.

5. **Compile Model**  
   - Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.0001)  
   - Loss: Categorical crossentropy  
   - Metrics: Accuracy and macro F1-score (via TensorFlow Addons)

6. **Train Model**  
   15 epochs training on training and validation datasets.

7. **Evaluate & Save**  
   Evaluated on validation set, saved model as `Eye_disease_prediction_model.h5` and training history as `training_history.pkl`.
